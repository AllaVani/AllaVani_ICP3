Description 1: The program starts by defining a class called Employee, which includes a data member named employee_count to keep track of the number of employees. The class also has a constructor (__init__) to initialize the attributes such as name, family, salary, and department. Additionally, there is a method (avg_sal) to calculate the average salary of a list of employees.

Next, a subclass named Fulltime_Employee is created, inheriting properties from the Employee class.The program includes a list of employees with different roles, each represented by an instance of either the Employee or Fulltime_Employee class. The average salary method is invoked for specific instances within the list.

Finally, the program prints the output, showcasing the calculated average salary for selected employees and the total count of employees.

Description 2: 
Random Vector Creation: Generates a random vector of size 20 with float values in the range of 1 to 20 using NumPy's np.random.uniform function.
Reshaping the Array: Reshapes the vector into a 4 by 5 matrix using the reshape method.
Replacing Max in Each Row: Utilizes NumPy indexing and functions to replace the maximum value in each row with 0 without employing a for loop. This is achieved through the combination of argmax and array indexing.
Output Display: Prints the resulting matrix after the specified replacements.
In summary, the code uses NumPy to create, reshape, and manipulate a random vector, showcasing efficient array operations without the need for explicit loops.
